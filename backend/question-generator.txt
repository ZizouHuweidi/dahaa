I need to create {number} multiple-choice questions about {category} at {difficulty} difficulty level. 

For each question, provide:
1. The question text
2. 4 possible answers (labeled A, B, C, D)
3. The correct answer (A, B, C, or D)
4. A brief explanation of the correct answer

Format the response as a JSON array of objects with this structure:
[
  {
    "question": "Question text?",
    "choices": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Brief explanation of the correct answer"
  }
]

Only include the JSON array in your response, with no additional text or markdown formatting.
